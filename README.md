# Bannerlord.YellToInspire

Ported crudly to e1.7.0.  
It has an interesting history. First based on [Xorberax's Press V to Yell](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/154), then reimagined with [Yell To Inspire - New Leadership Perks and Abilities](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/477), then ported [Yell To Inspire (Updated)](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/2155) and now having an 'enterprise grade rewrite Â©' with the addition of usage of MCM and ButterLib.
